### **What is Force?**  
**Force** is a push or pull acting upon an object that causes it to move, stop, or change direction. It is a **vector quantity**, meaning it has both **magnitude (size)** and **direction**.  

### **Formula of Force (Newton's Second Law)**  
\[
F = ma
\]
Where:  
- \( F \) = Force (Newton, **N**)  
- \( m \) = Mass (kg)  
- \( a \) = Acceleration (m/sÂ²)  

### **Types of Force**  
1. **Contact Forces** (require physical contact):  
   - **Applied Force** (push/pull)  
   - **Frictional Force** (opposes motion)  
   - **Normal Force** (support force by a surface)  
   - **Tension Force** (force in a string or rope)  
   - **Air Resistance** (opposes motion in air)  

2. **Non-Contact Forces** (act at a distance):  
   - **Gravitational Force** (attraction due to mass)  
   - **Magnetic Force** (between magnets)  
   - **Electrostatic Force** (between charged particles)  

### **Newtonâ€™s Laws of Motion (Related to Force)**  
1. **First Law (Law of Inertia)**: An object remains at rest or moves at a constant speed unless acted upon by an external force.  
2. **Second Law**: Force = Mass Ã— Acceleration.  
3. **Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  

### **Examples of Force in Everyday Life**  
- Kicking a football (Applied Force)  
- A falling apple (Gravitational Force)  
- Brakes slowing down a car (Frictional Force)  
- A stretched rubber band (Elastic Force)
